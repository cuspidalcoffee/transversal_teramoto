In [the tutorial](https://github.com/hiroshi-teramoto/mixed_module/blob/main/check_infinitesimal.md), the semi-algebraic sets in the list,



This souce code is to check ***. This can be done by computing the mixed standard basis of $T \mathcal{G} \left( f \right) + \mathcal{M}_2^2 \mathcal{E}_2^2$ and reduce the tangent vectors with respect to the standard basis (For detail, see the paper, 4.1.1). If this is not the case, the dimension of the orbit is strictly smaller than the dimension of the semi-algebraic set. This happens when the moduli appears.

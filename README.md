Implementation of Algorithms in the paper [Comprehensive Standard System for Generalized Mixed Module and its Application to Singularity Theory](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0219498824502219?journalCode=jaa) by Hiroshi Teramoto and Katsusuke Nabeshima

To use the libraries, download all the files and place them into a single directory. You will need Singular installed on your machine. We have prepared three examples to demonstrate the libraries:

* [example_codimension_transverse_fold.exe](https://github.com/hiroshi-teramoto/mixed_module/edit/main/example_codimension_transverse_fold.md)
  - See 3.1.1 Example (transverse fold) in the paper
* example_codimension_beak_to_beak.exe
  - See 3.1.2 Example (beak to beak) in the paper
* example_divergent_diagram_j1.exe
  - See 4.1.1 Example: Mather's lemma

We assume you are familiar with Singular. If not please refer to [the singular manual](https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/Manual/4-3-2/index.htm#SEC_Top).

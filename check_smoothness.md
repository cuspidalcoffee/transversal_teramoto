Let us explain how to confirm if a given semi-algebraic set $V \left( E \right) \setminus V \left( N \right)$ defined by the ideals $E$ and $N$ is a smooth manifold by using the constant rank theorem by taking semi-algebraic sets appearing in the classificaiton of divergent diagram as examples. In the classification, we got the following list of semi-algebraic sets: 

| # | Semi-Algebraic Set |
| = |------------------- |
| 1 | $c_1 = c_2 = c_3 = c_4 = 0$ |
| 2 | $c_1 c_4 - c_2 c_3 \neq 0$ |
| 3 | $c_1 c_4 - c_2 c_3 = 0$ and ($c_2 c_4 \neq 0$ or $c_1 c_4 \neq 0$ or $c_1 c_3 \neq 0$)  |
| 4 | $c_2 c_4 = c_1 c_4 = c_2 c_3 = c_1 c_3 = 0$ and ($c_1 \neq 0$ or $c_2 \neq 0$ or $c_3 \neq 0$ or $c_4 \neq 0$)  |

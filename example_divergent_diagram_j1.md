Let us explain how to use the library by taking example_divergent_diagram_j1.exe (See 4.1.1 Example: Mather's lemma in the paper) as an example. Specifically, this example involves several parameters and through this example you can learn how to handle that. For background, please refer to 4.1.1 Example: Mather's lemma.

The purpose here is to classify $1$-jet of the divergent diagram 
$$\left( f_1; f_2 \right) \colon \left( \mathbb{R}, 0 \right) \xleftarrow{f_1} \left( \mathbb{R}^2, 0 \right) \xrightarrow{f_2} \left( \mathbb{R}, 0 \right)$$
by using Mather's lemma. The general form of the $1$-jet can be written as:
$$j^1 f_1 \left( x \right) = c_1 x_1 + c_2 x_2 + \mathcal{M}_2^2 \mathcal{E}_2^2$$
$$j^1 f_2 \left( x \right) = c_3 x_1 + c_4 x_2 + \mathcal{M}_2^2 \mathcal{E}_2^2$$

Through that expression, we can see that the $1$-jet space is coordinated by $c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4 \in \mathbb{R}$.

The group acting on the divergent diagram $\mathcal{G}$ induces the Lie group $j^1 \mathcal{G}$ acting on the $1$-jet space and we want to decompose the $1$-jet space into distinct orbits of the induced action. Since the dimension of every orbit is constant under the setting, we first decompose the $1$-jet space into several components so that 
$$\dim_{\mathbb{R}} T_{j^1 f} \left( j^1 \mathcal{G} \cdot j^1 f \right)$$
is constant for each component. 

By the isomorphism in the paper (4.1), we obtain 
$$j^1 \mathcal{M}_2 \mathcal{E}_2^2 / T_{j^1 f} \left( j^1 \mathcal{G} \cdot j^1 f \right) \cong \left( \langle x_1, x_2 \rangle \mathbb{R} \left[ X_1 \right]_{\langle X_1 \rangle}^2 / M$$
(Note that the expression in (4.1) in the paper contains typo).
